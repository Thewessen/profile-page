# Profiling page on GitHub Pages

This repository contains a profile page showing some of the projects found [here]
[here on github](https://github.com/Thewessen). The page can be viewed live
[here](thewessen.github.io/profile-page).

This profile page is created using the data available from the GitHub API
v4. This pages is made using the VueJS-framework. Which created another
opportunity for me to learn a new webframework. It is a work in progress, and
content will be added on a weekly basis. If you see an interesting project
that isn't shown on the page, you'll probably find it on [my
github](https://github.com/Thewessen).
